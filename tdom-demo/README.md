# TDOM live demo server

To run it you will need Java (I use Java 11, but maybe earlier versions will work from console as well)

To start the server from console run

```
# gradlew
```

from the project root in command line.

This project also needs another one - tdom to be placed on the same level as tdom-demo root folder, since the server references files from ../tdom. This should happen automatically if you check out the whole repository.
